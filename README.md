# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Car-Game-using-OpenCV-MediaPipe-and-Pygame
**Introduction:**
This project demonstrates how to control a virtual car in a Pygame environment using hand gestures captured from a webcam. The car's movement is controlled by detecting the number of raised fingers using MediaPipe's hand-tracking capabilities. The project uses OpenCV to capture the webcam feed, MediaPipe for hand detection and finger counting, and Pygame to create a simple game environment.

Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects and counts the number of raised fingers.
Car Movement: Controls the car's movement (up, down, left, right) based on the number of fingers detected.
Interactive Game Environment: A simple car game using Pygame where the car's movement is controlled in real-time.
