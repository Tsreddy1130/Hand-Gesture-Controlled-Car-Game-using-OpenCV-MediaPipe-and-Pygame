## Introduction:
This project demonstrates how to control a virtual car in a Pygame environment using hand gestures captured from a webcam. The car's movement is controlled by detecting the number of raised fingers using MediaPipe's hand-tracking capabilities. The project uses OpenCV to capture the webcam feed, MediaPipe for hand detection and finger counting, and Pygame to create a simple game environment.

## Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects and counts the number of raised fingers.
Car Movement: Controls the car's movement (up, down, left, right) based on the number of fingers detected.
Interactive Game Environment: A simple car game using Pygame where the car's movement is controlled in real-time.
Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

### Python 3.6+  
### OpenCV (cv2)  
### MediaPipe  
### Pygame  



You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
`````pip install opencv-python mediapipe pygame`````


# How It Works
##  -Capture Webcam Input: ## The script captures video from your webcam using OpenCV.
##  -Detect Hand Gestures: ## MediaPipe processes the video feed to detect hand landmarks and count the number of raised fingers.
##  -Control Car Movement: ##The carâ€™s movement on the screen is controlled based on the finger count detected by MediaPipe.
##  -Render with Pygame: ## The car and game environment are displayed using Pygame.
**Add Your Car Image**:Place your car image (car.png) in the project directory. Make sure the image is named car.png or update the file name in the script accordingly.

## usage:
 you can either download the python file or simply clone the reposirity:
1. **Clone the Repository** ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-gesture-car-game.git```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory** ```cd hand-gesture-car-game```
3. **Add Your Car Image**:Place your car image (car.png) in the project directory. Make sure the image is named car.png or update the file name in the script accordingly.
4. **Run the Script**:```python main.py```

## outputs:
    if fingerCount == 1:--> move forward
    if fingerCount == 2:-->move backward
    if fingerCount == 3:-->move left
    if fingerCount == 4:-->move right
    if fingerCount == 5:-->stop
